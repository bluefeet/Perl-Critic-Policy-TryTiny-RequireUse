=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::TryTiny::RequireUse - Requires that code which utilizes
Try::Tiny actually use()es it.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A common problem with L<Try::Tiny> is forgetting to use the module in the first
place.  For example:

    perl -e 'try { print "hello" } catch { print "world" }'
    Can't call method "catch" without a package or object reference at -e line 1.
    helloworld

If you forget this then both code blocks will be run and an exception will be thrown.
While this seems like a rare issue, when I first implemented this policy I found
several cases of this issue in real live code and due to layers of exception handling
it had gotten lost and nobody realized that there was a bug happening due to the missing
use statements.

This policy is OK if you use L<Error>, L<Syntax::Feature::Try>, L<Try>, L<Try::Catch>,
and L<TryCatch> modules which also export the C<try> function.

=item *

The L<Perl::Critic::Policy::Dynamic::NoIndirect> policy provides a more generic
solution to this problem (as the author has reported to me).  Consider it as an
alternative to this policy.
